__Programming Stack : Java__  <br />
__Framework : Selenium and Cucumber__ <br />
__Reporting : Extent Reports__

## This Framework Contains
__Feature Files__ <br />
__Step Definition Files__ <br /> 
__Page Object model__ <br />
__Hooks__ <br />
__Test Runner__

## Setup to run code
__Clone the repository using "git clone"__ <br />
__Run "mvn clean test"__ <br />
__Run "mvn test"__ <br />

## Approach
- First I have collected all the locators which are required for automating both tests.
- After that, I created Feature files first.
- After that, I created Step Definition files for all the scenarios and common hook files.
- The next step is to create a Page Object file for all the step definition files.
- After this, I set up Cucumber TestRunner I have provided the addresses of both Step Definition and Scenario files.
- I used Extent Reports for reporting.
